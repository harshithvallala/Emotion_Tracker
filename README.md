## Overview
This project performs Sentiment Analysis on text data, classifying tweets or reviews as positive, negative, or neutral. Sentiment analysis helps businesses and researchers gain insights into public opinion, customer feedback, and social trends. The project leverages PyTorch to build a deep learning model that can efficiently process and analyze large volumes of text data.

## Features
- **Sentiment Classification**: Predicts if a given text is positive, negative, or neutral.
- **PyTorch Implementation**: Uses PyTorch to build a deep learning model for sentiment analysis.
- **Preprocessed Dataset**: Uses a Twitter dataset for training and testing the model.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Interactive notebooks for training, evaluation, and visualization.
- **Easy Customization**: Adaptable for other types of text data or sentiment scoring.

## Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

### Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/rohanpashikanti/sentiment-analysis.git
```

### Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd sentiment-analysis
```

### Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
```bash
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate
```

### Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Download the dataset (if not included):
Place your dataset (e.g., `Twitter_Data.csv`) in the `/data` folder.

## Usage
Once the setup is complete, you can run the Jupyter notebooks for training and analysis:

### Open the notebooks:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```

### Train the model:
Open `pytorch_sentiment_analysis.ipynb` to train the model on the Twitter dataset.

### Evaluate the model:
After training, evaluate model performance using the provided evaluation scripts.

### Analyze new data:
Modify the input data in `sentiment_analysis.ipynb` to analyze new tweets or text data.

## Technologies
- **Python**: Programming language.
- **PyTorch**: Deep learning framework for building and training models.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For running interactive scripts.
- **Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)**: For text preprocessing (optional).

## Model Performance
- **Accuracy**: 89%
- **Precision**: 87%
- **Recall**: 85%
- **F1 Score**: 86%

Model performance may vary based on the dataset and tuning parameters.
